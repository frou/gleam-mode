gleam-ts-mode: An Emacs Major Mode for [Gleam]
==============================================

This mode uses [tree-sitter] (and Emacs 29's `treesit` package) under-the-hood for syntax highlighting and code navigation.  If you're using an Emacs that's older than 29 (run `M-x version` to find out), or a version compiled without `treesit` (run `M-: (treesit-available-p)` to find out), you probably want [gleam-mode] instead.

Setup
-----

This project will eventually be hosted on [MELPA]. However, until that time, the best way to install this is first to clone the project:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:gleam-lang/gleam-mode
```

Then you'll need to load this from your init script (`~/.emacs` or `~/.config/emacs/init.el`).

### use-package (recommended)

```elisp
(use-package gleam-ts-mode
  :load-path "~/path/to/gleam-mode"
  :mode (rx ".gleam" eos))
```

Replace `~/path/to/gleam-mode` with the path where you cloned gleam-mode.

### vanilla

```elisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/path/to/gleam-mode")
(load-library "gleam-ts-mode")
```

Replace `~/path/to/gleam-mode` with the path where you cloned gleam-mode.

### Install the Tree-Sitter Grammar

Unless you have the Gleam tree-sitter grammar installed and treesit knows where to find it, you'll want to run `M-x gleam-ts-install-grammar`.  It should only take a moment, but does require that your OS has a C compiler available.

gleam-mode: An Alternative Emacs Major Mode for [Gleam]
=======================================================

This mode uses [tree-sitter] alongside [tree-sitter-mode] and [tree-sitter-indent] for syntax highlighting and code navigation.

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2058614/151681785-5d212e1b-191b-4e7d-a868-f6e42d7efe61.mp4

Setup
-----

The best way to install this is first to clone the project:

```
$ git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:gleam-lang/gleam-mode
```

Then you'll need to load this from your init script (`~/.emacs` or `~/.config/emacs/init.el`).

### use-package (recommended)

```elisp
(use-package gleam-mode
  :load-path "~/path/to/gleam-mode")
```

Replace `~/path/to/gleam-mode` with the path where you cloned gleam-mode.

### vanilla

```elisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/path/to/gleam-mode")
(load-library "gleam-mode")
```

Replace `~/path/to/gleam-mode` with the path where you cloned gleam-mode.

Configuration
-------------

gleam-mode ships with a `gleam-format` command that is not bound by default to any keybinding. To bind it:

### use-package

Add `:bind (:map gleam-mode-map (<binding> . gleam-format))` to your use-package declaration. e.g.

```elisp
(use-package gleam-mode
  :load-path "~/path/to/gleam-mode"
  :bind (:map gleam-mode-map
              ("C-c g f" . gleam-format)))
```

(here "C-c g f" means `Control`+`C` followed by `g` followed by `f`)

### vanilla

Add the following after the lines where you setup gleam-mode:

```elisp
(define-key gleam-mode-map (kbd "C-c g f") 'gleam-format)
```

(here "C-c g f" means `Control`+`C` followed by `g` followed by `f`)

### automatically format on save

Alternatively, add these lines to your configuration to automatically run `gleam-format` on save:

``` elisp
    (add-hook 'gleam-mode-hook
              (lambda () (add-hook 'before-save-hook 'gleam-format nil t)))
```
